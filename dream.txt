			A DREAM...
			
YOU FALL ASLEEP IN YOUR BED WITHOUT KNOWING IF IT'S DAY TIME OR NIGHT TIME...
YOU SLEEP AND YOU HAVE A DREAM - YOU DREAM ABOUT A CHILDHOOD MEMORY OF YOURS...

YOU ARE 6 YEARS OLD AND YOU PLAY IN A GARDEN WITH TREES AND BUSHES... YOU PLAY BY YOURSELF...

NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT YOUR ROOM PLAYING WITH YOUR TOYS AGAIN ALONE...

YOUR MOM COMES AND ASK YOU "WHY ARE YOU PLAYING BY YOURSELF? WHY ARE YOU PLAYING ALONE?"...

YOU WAKE UP AND YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS "I ALWAYS WAS ALONE... EVEN AS A CHILD I HAD
NO ONE TO PLAY WITH..." THEN YOU RECALL THAT THE OTHER PUPILS IN SCHOOL HATED YOU 
AND MOCKED YOU "I WAS ALWAYS DIFFERENT" YOU THINK TO YOURSELF...

YOU GET MAD AND ANGRY - EVEN YOUR FIRST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ARE OF REJECTION...
THEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR ISOLATION IS NOT BY YOUR CHOICE AND FREE WILL BUT
IT'S SOMETHING IMPOSED ON YOU... "PEOPLE ARE JUST NO GOOD" YOU THINK TO YOURSELF

THEN YOU ASK YOURSELF "AM I TRULY HAPPY WITH THE WAY THAT I AM ISOLATED FROM SOCIETY?"
