				THE LOVE SONG...
				
YOU PICK UP AGAIN YOUR GUITAR AND WIPE THE DUST FROM THE STRINGS...

THIS TIME YOU PLAY A LOVE SONG FROM YOUR HEART TO... SOMEONE IN THE FUTURE... SOMEONE SPECIAL 
THAT SOMEDAY WILL LOVE YOU AND YOU WILL LOVE HER... YOU PURE YOUR HEART ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO 
IMAGINE THE MOMENTS WITH HER... AND YOU SING JUST FOR HER NOT CARING WHO IS LISTENING...

YOU START AS THE SONG GOES ON TO BELIEVE THAT TRUE LOVE DOES EXIST AND IS JUST WAITING FOR YOU 
AND ANYTHING IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE POSSIBLE...

IN YOUR IMAGINATION YOU AND YOUR LOVE LIVE TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU ARE NOT ALONE ANY 
MORE YOU ARE WITH THE WOMAN YOU LOVE... AND YOU ARE BOTH TRUE TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT PLAYING 
GAMES AND WITHOUT CHEATING... "LOVE IS ALWAYS TRUE..." YOU THINK TO YOURSELF... THERE IS OUT 
THERE IN THE BIG WORLD SOMEONE WHO IS JUST WAITING FOR YOU... CALL IT FAITH OR DESTINY OR 
WHATEVER "LOVE IS ALWAYS TRUE AND LOVE IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE..." LIKE YOUR MOM ALWAYS SAYS...

YOU FINISH THE SONG HAPPY KNOWING IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME TILL YOU WILL FIND THAT SOMEONE 
SPECIAL TO LOVE...
