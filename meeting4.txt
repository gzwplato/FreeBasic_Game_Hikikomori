						THE WORKSHOP

YET ANOTHER SUPPORT GROUP AND BY THIS TIME YOU FEEL YOU HAD ENOUGH OF
"SUPPORT" AND FEEL THAT YOU ARE STUCK AND GETTING NOWHERE. AT THE END
OF THE MEETING YOU GO AND TALK TO THE STAFF AND TELL THEM YOU ARE INTERESTED
IN GOING TO A WORKSHOP AND GETTING SOME JOB SKILLS IN ORDER TO FIND A JOB
THE STAFF ENROLL YOU TO ONE OF THE WORKSHOP AVAILABLE AND YOU SAY GOODBYE
TO JIM AND LISA AND TELL THEM THAT FROM NOW ON YOU'LL BE COMING TO THE
WORKSHOP INSTEAD OF THE SUPPORT GROUP AND THAT YOU DECIDED TO LEARN WEB
DESIGN AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING... YOU RECEIVE AN OLD LAPTOP THAT STILL
WORK FROM THE CENTER IN ORDER TO STUDY AND DO HOME WORK FROM HOME AND
YOU STAY A LITTLE BIT IN THE WORKSHOP GETTING TO KNOW THE TEACHERS AND 
STUDENTS. THE COURSE IS 4 MONTHS LONG AND YOU HAVE TO ATTEND EACH DAY
IT'S A COMMITMENT THAT YOU TAKE ON YOURSELF WILLINGLY...
