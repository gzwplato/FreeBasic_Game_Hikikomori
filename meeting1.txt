					NEW FRIENDS
					
YOU GO OUT AGAIN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE YUKA SUPPORT GROUP. YOU ARE
A BIT NERVES... YOU GET THERE JUST IN TIME AND THIS TIME YOU TAKE
A PART AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO THE GROUP AND TALK ABOUT YOURSELF A BIT

THE GROUP WELCOMES YOU AND ONCE THE MEETING IS FINISHED TWO PEOPLE FROM
THE GROUP STAY A BIT AND COME TO TALK TO YOU. THE FIRST ONE IS JIM WHO 
SAYS HE KNOWS HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE THE FIRST STEPS OUT AND THAT HE ALSO
WRITE POEMS LIKE YOU "MAYBE WE CAN READ EACH OTHERS POEMS?" HE SAYS SMILING...

AFTER HIM COMES TO TALK TO YOU LISA "NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN" SHE SAYS SMILING
A SHY SMILE

YOU GO HOME FEELING A BIT STRANGE BUT YOU ARE EXCITED AND WAITING FOR THE
NEXT MEETING...
