				LISTENING TO MUSIC
				
YOU OPEN THE RADIO ON YOUR FAVORITE STATION THAT YOU LIKED AS A TEEN
WHEN NIRVANA AND GRANGE AND MTV WAS THE COOLEST THING AROUND AND WENT
HAND IN HAND LIKE SOME COCA COLA AND ICE-CREAM IN A WARM SUMMEAR DAY

IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME - KURT COBAINE IS DEAD AND SO IS NIRVANA
GRANGE IS OVER AND THE MUSIC YOU USED TO LOVE AND DANCE TO IS NO MORE
INSTEAD THERE ARE NEW BANDS WITH ELECTRO-HOUSE-HIP-HOP MUSIC YOU DON'T
DIG ANY-MORE... YOU ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE AN OLD MAN LISTENING TO CHILDREN'S
SHIT MUSIC...

YOU TRY TO DANCE ALONE IN THE ROOM TRY TO FEEL SOMETHING OR REMEMBER HOW
IT USED TO BE... BUT YOU DANCE ALONE WITHOUT YOUR HIGH SHCOOL FRIENDS
WITHOUT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM THE SAME...

YOU TURN THE RADIO OFF AND JUST SIT AT YOUR BED CRYING...
