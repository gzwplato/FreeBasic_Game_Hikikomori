					THE PRAY SONG NUMBER 2...
					
YOU PICK UP YOUR DUSTY GUITAR AND START TO PLAY ON IT... SOON YOU START TO SING...
IT IS ANOTHER PRAY SONG TO THE DIVINE... YOU PURE YOUR HEART OUT PRAYING FOR LOVE
COMPANIONSHIP HONOR PEACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT THERE ARE IN THE WORLD...

IT'S A SUNNY AFTERNOON AND YOU LOOK AT THE VIEW FROM YOUR ROON'S WINDOW...
HOW THE WIND PLAYS WITH THE TREE'S LEAVES AND HOW THE BIRDS FLY... IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
DAY OUTSIDE... YOU SEE PEOPLE GOING AROUND THEIR BUSINESS SO FREE AND HAPPY...
YOU ENVY THEM TELLING YOURSELF HOW THEY ARE LUCKY WITHOUT KNOWING... THE SKY IS BLUE
WITH BEAUTIFUL WHITE CLOUDS THE SUN IS SHINING... AND YOUR STUCK HERE IN YOUR ROOM...

YOU PRAY TO ONE DAY BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD AND CLAIM YOUR PLACE IN IT...
