					MUSIC AND DANCING...
					
YOU TURN THE RADIO ON AND START TO DANCE IS YOUR ROOM... YOU FEEL MORE AND MORE
JOYFUL... THE SADNESS FALLS FROM YOU AS YOU FEEL ALIVE AND YOU IMAGINE YOU ARE
DANCING IN A ROOM FULL OF DANCING PEOPLE... YOU LAUGH AND SMILE... YOU ARE FULL OF
HOPE THAT ONE DAY THIS CAN BE TRUE AND REAL... YOU START YO IMAGINE YOU ARE DANCING
WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND YOU FEEL REAL HAPPY...

YOUR HEAD SPINS AND YOU SIT TO REST SWEATING... BUT IN YOUR MIND YOU ARE FREE AS A
BIRD THAT FLY FAR AWAY ON THE WINGS OF MUSIC... YOU ARE ONCE MORE AFTER ALONG TIME
FREE AND FULL OF HOPE...
