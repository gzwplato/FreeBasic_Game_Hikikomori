r:it's hard to live a normal life with a job and social life when you sleep all day :(
r:it's 5 am here ruffly and i haven't slept all night i stayed awake and played video games on my computer as usual

r:i miss having fun with my lost friends i bet thet don't even remember me if they ever think of me :(
r:i miss the way i was before i became isolated i used to laugh smile be social have fun with my friends and my sweetheart now i feel like a half dead zombie :(
r:one of my motivations to get better and succeed is to make my mom and dad happy and proud of me and show everyone that i'm not lost or doomed
r:my family sends me money but i guess as far of hoping that i will succeed in getting out of isolation i think they gave up on me
