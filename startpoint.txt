				STARTING POINT...
				
YOU ARE A 24 YEARS OLD YOUNG MAN AND THE TIME IS THE ENDING OF THE 90'S
YOU HAD A NORMAL LIFE AND A GOOD CHILDHOOD WITH YOUR BELOVED FAMILY
YOU FINISHED HIGH SHCOOL AND WENT TO COLLEDGE TO STUDY COMPUTER SIENCE
AND YOU STARTED TO WORK AS A CASHIER AT A LOCAK SUPERMARKET...

THINGS LOOKED PROMISSING AND LIFE SEEMED TO SMILE AT YOU UNTIL...

ONE DAY YOU WERE BULLYIED BY A FEW STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY...
AROUND THAT TIME YOU CAUGHT YOUR GIRLFRIEND CHEETING ON YOU WITH ONE
OF YOUR FRIENDS... AND YOU STARTED TO FAILE AT THE COURSES AT THE
UNIVERSITY...

SOMETHING INSIDE YOU WAS BROKEN TO LITTLE PICESES AND YOU WHERE TOLD
BY PEOPLE THAT WHERE CONSORNED ABOUT YOU "MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEEK HELP"
OR "WHY DON'T YOU GO FOR SOME CONSELLING?"

AT FRIRST YOU LISTEN TO THEM BUT WHEN THE COUNSLER TOLD YOU YOU NEED
PSYCHIATRIC HELP AND YOU MAYBE SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL CONDISION
YOU SUDDENLY QUITTED YOUR WORK AND STUDIES AND RAN AWAY BACK TO YOUR
PARANTS

HERE FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS YOU ARE ISOLATED IN YOUR ROOM AT YOUR PERANTS
HOUSE... THE ROOM YOU GROW UP IN... YOU FEEL YOU LOST ALL FAITH IN PEOPLE
YOU BEARLY LEAVE THE HOUSE OR YOUR ROOM... YOU DON'T WHANT TO SEE ANYONE
YOU PASS THE TIME PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES AND LISTENING TO MUSIC...
YOUR BELOVED PARENTS ARE CONCERNED BUT HOPE ONE DAY YOU WILL GO BACK
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD... 

YOU ARE A HIKIKOMORI - A SOCIAL LONER WITH NO SOCIAL CONNECTION OR WITH OUT
A SOCIAL LIFE... YOU HAVE NO MONEY NO JOB NO NOTHING... YOU SLEEP MOST
OF THE DAY AND AWAKE MOST OF THE NIGHT...
