				STARTING POINT...
				
YOU ARE A 24 YEARS OLD YOUNG MAN AND THE TIME IS THE ENDING OF THE 90'S
YOU HAD A NORMAL LIFE AND A GOOD CHILDHOOD WITH YOUR BELOVED FAMILY
YOU FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND WENT TO COLLEGE TO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE
AND YOU STARTED TO WORK AS A CASHIER AT A LOCAL SUPERMARKET...

THINGS LOOKED PROMISING AND LIFE SEEMED TO SMILE AT YOU UNTIL...

ONE DAY YOU WERE BULLIED BY A FEW STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY...
AROUND THAT TIME YOU CAUGHT YOUR GIRLFRIEND CHEATING ON YOU WITH ONE
OF YOUR FRIENDS... AND YOU STARTED TO FAIL AT THE COURSES AT THE
UNIVERSITY...

SOMETHING INSIDE YOU WAS BROKEN TO LITTLE PISCES AND YOU WHERE TOLD
BY PEOPLE THAT WHERE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU "MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEEK HELP"
OR "WHY DON'T YOU GO FOR SOME COUNSELLING?"

AT FIRST YOU LISTEN TO THEM BUT WHEN THE COUNSELLOR TOLD YOU YOU NEED
PSYCHIATRIC HELP AND YOU MAYBE SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL CONDITION
YOU SUDDENLY QUIETED YOUR WORK AND STUDIES AND RAN AWAY BACK TO YOUR
PARENTS

HERE FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS YOU ARE ISOLATED IN YOUR ROOM AT YOUR PARENTS
HOUSE... THE ROOM YOU GROW UP IN... YOU FEEL YOU LOST ALL FAITH IN PEOPLE
YOU BARELY LEAVE THE HOUSE OR YOUR ROOM... YOU DON'T WHAT TO SEE ANYONE
YOU PASS THE TIME PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES AND LISTENING TO MUSIC...
YOUR BELOVED PARENTS ARE CONCERNED BUT HOPE ONE DAY YOU WILL GO BACK
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD... 

YOU ARE A HIKIKOMORI - A SOCIAL LONER WITH NO SOCIAL CONNECTION OR WITH OUT
A SOCIAL LIFE... YOU HAVE NO MONEY NO JOB NO NOTHING... YOU SLEEP MOST
OF THE DAY AND AWAKE MOST OF THE NIGHT...
