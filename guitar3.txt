				THE BLUES SONG...
				
YOUR NEIGHBOUR MIKE HEARS YOU PLAY THE GUITAR AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR "HI I HEARD YOUR GUITAR SO I 
DROP BY WITH MY GUITAR TO ASK IF YOU WOULD LIKE US TO PLAY A SONG TOGETHER?" HE SMILES... YOU 
HESITATE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAY "YES OKAY LET'S PLAY SOME BLUES TOGETHER..."

YOU BOTH GO TO YOUR ROOM AND MIKE STARTS TO PLAY THE BLUES HE PLAYS BETTER THEN YOU AND YOU 
START TO SING WHATEVER YOUR HEARTS FEEL LIKE AND IT FEELS LIKE FREEDOM! TWO GUYS PLAYING THE 
BLUES! YOU TAKE ALL THE BAD FEELINGS AND TURN THEN INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL...

MIKE STICKS AROUND FOR A WHILE AND YOU PLAY SOME MORE SONGS THEN HE SAYS "THANKS NEIGHBOUR I 
HOPE TO KEEP HEARING YOU PLAY GUITAR AND SING YOUR SONGS I REALLY LIKE THEM..." AND GOES BACK 
HOME...

HIS THE FIRST PERSON TO BE IN YOUR ROOM FOR YEARS AND HE WAS NICE HE KNOWS LIKE ALL THE 
NEIGHBOURS THAT YOU ARE ISOLATED IN YOUR ROOM BUT HIS THE FIRST NEIGHBOUR TO ACTUALLY DO 
SOMETHING NICE WITH YOU... YOU TELL YOURSELF "NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE BAD... SOME ARE KIND AND GOOD 
AND THEY'RE WORTH ME GOING OUT OF MY ROOM AND HOUSE TO MEET THEM"...
