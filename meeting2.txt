				NEW ADVENTURES

YOU GO OUT TO ANOTHER SUPPORT GROUP MEETING THIS TIME IT FEELS
A BIT MORE NATURAL... BUT THE BIG THING HAPPENS AFTER THE MEETING IS
OVER... JIM AND LISA INVITES YOU TO SIT WITH THEM IN THE CAFETERIA...

YOU SIT THERE WITH THEM YOU ALL DRINK SODA AND COFFEE AND EAT SOME
SANDWICHES... AND YOU ALL OPEN UP AND TELL ABOUT YOURSELVES AND START
TELLING JOKES AND FOOLING AROUND YOU TALK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES AND WHAT 
WAS THE LAST MOVIE YOU ALL SAW IN A REAL CINEMA OR TV... YOU TALK ABOUT
FAVORITE MUSIC AND CELEBRITIES AND TIMES SEEMS LIKE IT FLY'S AWAY

AFTER HAVING THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE YOU SAY GOODBYE TO THEM AND RETURN
TO YOUR ROOM AT YOUR PARENTS HOME WHEN IT'S 5 AM IN THE MORNING

YOU SMILE CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS YOU HAD REAL FUN
