				THE DREAM ABOUT LOVE...
				
YOU FALL ASLEEP AT MIDNIGHT AND DREAM ABOUT THE GIRL YOU LOVED FROM YOUR HIGH SCHOOL...

ONCE AGAIN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE SAME CLASS AS HER LOOKING AT HER AND SHE'S SO POPULAR AND 
BEAUTIFUL... YOU HEAR IN YOUR HEAD THE SONG "CREEP" BY THE BAND "RADIOHEAD"...

YOU DON'T DARE TO LET HER OR ANYONE KNOW YOU HAVE A "CRUSH" OVER HER... SHE DOESN'T NOTICE YOU
AT ALL YOU ARE LIKE AIR TO HER AND IT HURTS... AFTER SCHOOL AT HOME YOU SIT AT YOUR ROOM (THE
SAME ROOM YOU NOW ISOLATE YOURSELF IN) AND FANTASIES ON HER... YOU KNOW SHE LIKE ALL THE OTHER
POPULAR PUPILS DESPISE YOU...

YOU DREAM IT'S PRAM NIGHT AND YOU SNUGGLE IN TO THE PARTY CAUSE YOU ARE NOT INVITED YOU HEARD 
SHE'S GOING TO A FAR AWAY COLLAGE AND YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER SEE HER AGAIN... YOU LOOK AT HER
AND YOU WANT TO ASK HER TO DANCE WITH YOU - ONE LAST DANCE... YOU DECIDE YOU GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
AND GO TO HER - YOUR HANDS SWEAT AND YOUR HEART BEATS FAST... YOU ASK HER IF SHE WANTS TO DANCE
SHE LOOKS AT YOU WITH DISGUST LOOK AND START TO LAUGH AND LAUGH LOADER AND LOADER... SHE TELLS
YOU TO "GET LOST LOSER" AND YOU WALK AWAY WITH TEARS IN YOUR EYES...

YOU GO HOME AND AT YOUR ROOM YOU THINK OF HER AND START TO HATE HER DEEPLY AND FEEL ANGER OVER
YOURSELF FOR LOVING HER... YOU WANT TO KILL HER BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HER BREAK HER PERFECT BODY
"WHO THE HELL DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?" YOU TELL YOURSELF "SHE CALLS ME A LOSER AND SHE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME! HOW DARE SHE!?"... SHE BROKE YOUR HEART WITH ONE SENTENCE WITHOUT
EVEN CARING... YOU START TO CRY... AND YOU WAKE UP SAD ALTHOUGH MANY YEARS HAS PASSED YOU 
STILL REMEMBER THE INSULT AND THE PAIN OF BEING REJECTED BY SOMEONE YOU LOVED SECRETLY...
