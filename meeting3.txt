						THE FUTURE
						
THIS IS YET ANOTHER GROUP MEETING IN THE YUKA CENTER AND THIS TIME THE SUBJECT
IS THE FUTURE OR "WHAT KIND OF LIFE DO YOU WISH TO HAVE?"... A LOT OF THE MEMBERS
ARE SILENT THIS TIME AND SOME TELL THE GROUP THEY CAN'T SEE ANY FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES
WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN TO SPEAK YOU SIMPLY SAY "I WISH TO GET A JOB AND HAVE MONEY AND
INCOME SO I CAN RENT A SMALL APARTMENT AND LIVE MY LIFE INDEPENDENTLY" THE OTHERS
TALK ABOUT "NOT BEING ALONE" OR "HAVING LOTS OF GOOD FRIENDS" OR "MAKING MY FAMILY
PROUD OF ME" ETC.

WHEN THE MEETING IS OVER JIM AND LISA COMES TO YOU AND ASK YOU IF YOU WISH TO GO 
WITH THEN TO SEE SOME MOVIE IN A CINEMA NEAR THE CENTER YOU SAY YES AND THE THREE
OF YOU GO TO SEE SOME SILLY COMEDY. THE THEATER IS MOSTLY EMPTY. YOU EAT POPCORN
AND DRINK SODA THEN JIM INVITES ALL OF YOU TO HIS APARTMENT WHERE HE SHOWS YOU HIS
COLLECTIONS OF RARE COMICS BOOKS AND PAGES OF POETRY HE WROTE OVER THE YEARS...
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT YOU JUST SIT ALL THREE OF YOU AT A PARK NEAR BY AND TALK ABOUT
LIFE AND WHAT KIND OF FUTURE YOU ALL WISH FOR YOURSELVES. JIM SAYS HE WOULD LIKE TO
BE A WRITER LISA SAYS SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP AND HAVE A
BOYFRIEND SOMEONE TO LOVE. AND YOU SAY YOU WISH TO NOT BE ALONE BUT HAVE GOOD POSITIVE
PEOPLE AROUND YOU AS FRIENDS...

YOU LOOK AT THE SUNRISE TOGETHER AND GO EACH ONE HOME... ALL THE WAY BACK TO YOUR ROOM
YOU THINK WHAT KIND OF JOB WOULD YOU LIKE TO AND CAN WORK IN... YOU GET HOME BY MORNING
AND GO RIGHT TO BED IN YOUR ROOM...
