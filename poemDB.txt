p:AT MY HEART THERE IS SADNESS TODAY
p:MY ROOM IS LONELY AS ME... HAPPY MEMORIES TURNED TO SAD REALITY
p:THE VIEW OUTSIDE MY WINDOWS BLINDS ME WITH SORROW AND EXCITEMENT
p:IN MY DREAMS I AM LOST INSIDE MEMORIES FROM A PAST LIFE I WISH TO LIVE AGAIN 
p:TIME MOVES SLOWLY AS THE YEARS RUN AWAY FROM ME AND I'M LEFT AS AN EMPTY SHELL AN OLD CHILD LEFT BY HIMSELF
p:SLOWLY WITH TIME PLUS LONELINESS I AM GOING OUT OF MY MIND
p:HOW LONG SHELL IT TAKE? A MINUTE IS LIKE A YEAR AND A YEAR SEEMS TO PASS LIKE SECONDS 
p:I AM GETTING OLD BUT THE WORLD OUTSIDE MY ROOM STAYS FOREVER YOUNG AND JOYFUL
p:TRYING TO PASS THE TIME SOMEHOW I FEEL AS IF THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED ME ANYMORE
p:FORGOTTEN DESERTED FORSAKEN I LOCKED MY SELF IN MY ROOM
c:I BARE NOT LOOK AT THE MIRROR ANYMORE NOT TO SEE HOW I WILT FROM DAY TO DAY...
c:I LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MY HEART CRIES OUT "ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL"...
c:WHERE ARE ALL MY LOST FRIENDS? WHERE IS EVERYONE? I CRY BUT NO ONE IS THERE
c:AFTER MIDNIGHT I SEARCH THE WEB FOR SOME COMPANION AND I FIND ALL THE LOST SOULS OF THE NIGHT 
c:I PRETEND THAT I CAN GET USED TO THIS PRETEND THAT I DON'T NEED NOBODY BUT THE OPPOSITE IS THE TRUTH 
c:WHAT SHELL BECOME OF ME? HOW LONG SHELL IT BE SO?

b:I WILL KEEP TRYING AND NEVER GIVE UP ON MYSELF CAUSE I AM WORTH IT
b:I AM SURE THAT IT'S A MATTER OF 'WHEN' AND NOT 'IF' I'LL MAKE IT OUT OF HERE
b:I TRY TO KEEP IN MIND HOW WONDERFUL IT WILL BE TO WALK IN THE WORLD BY DAYLIGHT NOT AFRAID FROM NOTHING 
b:I MUST REMEMBER THAT THINGS CAN BE JUST AS WONDERFUL AND GOOD JUST AS THEY CAN BE HORRIBLE AND BAD
b:IF I LOVE I CAN BE LOVED IF I GOOD TO OTHERS SO WILL SOME OF THEM BE GOOD TO ME... NO?
b:SITTING HERE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT I MUST TRY TO REMEMBER IT'S NOT ALL BLACK AND WHITE!
b:AS LONG AS THERE IS LOVE LIGHT AND LIFE THERE IS HOPE I MUST NOT GIVE UP
