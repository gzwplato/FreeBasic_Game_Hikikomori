				THE DREAM ABOUT EDDIE...
				
YOU FALL ASLEEP IN THE EVENING AND HAVE A BAD DREAM ABOUT EDDIE... EDDIE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND 
DURING JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL... FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS YOU BOTH WERE INSEPARABLE AND ALWAYS 
WERE TOGETHER AND DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER... YOU KNEW EACH OTHER WELL AND HANGOUT TOGETHER 
TALKED TO EACH OTHER JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING... EDDIE WAS A SHAY INSECURE TEEN... AND HE ALSO TOLD 
YOU HE WAS GAY AND IN THE CLOSET... AND ASKED YOU NOT TO TELL HIS SECRET TO ANYONE AND YOU AS A 
DEAR CLOSE FRIEND AGREED... TIME PASSED AND BY MID HIGH SCHOOL EDDIE BECAME MORE SECURED AND 
CONFIDENT WITH HIS SEXUALITY AND WITH HIMSELF AND DECIDED TO COME OUT AS GAY...

THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT EDDIE WANTED THE "BIG LIFE" AND HE WASN'T GOING TO SETTLE FOR LESS... 
IF HE'S GAY THAN ALL OF HIS FRIENDS MUST ALSO BE GAY LIKE HIM EDDIE FROM A SHAY SENSITIVE 
PERSON BECAME A MILITANT AGGRESSIVE UGLY PERSON AND HE STARTED TO BE MEAN TO YOU AS A "STRAIGHT 
MALE". "YOU MUST BE GAY LIKE ME" HE USED TO SAY "OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T AGREE TO STAY FRIENDS 
WITH ME ALL THOSE YEARS" AND WHEN YOU TOLD HIM YOU ARE NOT GAY HE LAUGHED AND USED TO SAY 
"THEN YOU MUST BE A HOMOPHOBIC WHO DENY HIS OWN HOMOSEXUALITY - I KNOW YOU AND I KNOW DEEP DOWN 
YOU'RE GAY YOU'RE JUST AFRAID TO ADMIT IT!"...

DURING YOUR LAST YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL EDDIE FOUND NEW GAY FRIENDS AND HE DIDN'T NEED OR WANT 
YOUR COMPANY ANY MORE IN FACT YOU FOUND OUT THAT EDDIE WAS SPREADING RUMOURS ABOUT YOU AT 
SCHOOL TELLING EVERYONE THAT YOU HOMOSEXUAL AND A HOMOPHOBIC AND YOU ARE MESSED UP

YOU WENT AND HAD THE LAST TALK WITH HIM OR MORE TO SAY AN ARGUMENT "JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE OPENLY 
GAY DOESN'T MEAN THE WHOLE WORLD IS GAY!" YOU YELLED AT HIM BUT HE JUST LAUGHED AND SAID "I 
DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHIT FROM YOU! FUCK YOU! YOUR AN ASSHOLE! YOUR A FUCKING JOKE! GO ON 
DENY YOUR HOMOSEXUALITY I DON'T CARE... BY THE TIME YOUR 40 YOU'LL REALIZE I WAS RIGHT BUT IT 
WILL BE TOO LATE AND YOU'LL GROW OLD ALONE AND DIE ALONE..."

AT YOUR LAST YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL EVERYBODY IN SCHOOL TALKS ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK CALLING 
YOU A FAGGOT WHILE EDDIE IS HAVING FUN WITH HIS LITTLE GROUP OF LGBT FRIENDS AND PLANNING HIS 
LIFE AFTER GRADUATION DAY...

EDDIE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL LEFT TOWN TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU NEVER HEARD FROM HIM SINCE...
EDDIE WAS YOUR JUDAS AND NEMESIS... YOU WAKE UP ANGRY SORRY YOU DIDN'T BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM 
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE...
