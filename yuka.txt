					THE VISIT...

IT'S LATE EVENING BUT YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND AND YOU GO OUT TO THE YUKA CENTER
AFTER ONE HOUR BUS DRIVE YOU'RE THERE AND BEFORE YOU IS A LARGE BUILDING... AS YOU
ENTER YOU SWEAT AND YOU ARE GREETED BY AN OVER FRIENDLY SMILING STAFF MEMBER
YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF BEFORE HER AND SHE ESCORT YOU TO A ROOM WHERE THERE IS A 
SUPPORT GROUP MEETING... YOU SIT FOR A WHOLE HOUR WITH TEN OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
THEY ARE POLITY AND GENTLE THEY ARE ALL LIKE YOU - ISOLATED FROM SOCIETY IN THEIR ROOM
IN THEIR PARENTS HOME OR IN THEIR OWN APARTMENT... YOU FIND IT HARD TO REMEMBER THEIR NAMES
THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS AND EXPERIENCES ABOUT THEIR HARDSHIP'S AND STRUGGLES
YOU FIND YOURSELF AMAZED YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO GOES THROUGH SIMILAR THINGS

AFTER AN HOUR THE MEETING IS FINISHED YOU ARE ASKED BY THE GUIDE IF YOU WOULD
LIKE TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING IN THE GROUP...
