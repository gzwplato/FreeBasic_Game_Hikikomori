				THE WALK...
				
YOU GO OUTSIDE FOR A WALK THE TIME IS ABOUT PASS MIDNIGHT... YOU WALK ALONE THROUGH YOUR
NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET WHICH ARE EMPTY AND THE ONLY LIGHT IS FROM THE STREET LAMPS... YOU WALK
THROUGH THE STREETS OF YOUR CHILDHOOD PASS YOUR HIGH SCHOOL AND PLAYGROUND YOU USED TO GO TO
EACH DAY... MEMORIES RISE OF LOST FRIENDS AND MOMENTS FROZEN IN TIME... YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR
LIFE... YOUR PAST... EMOTIONS LIKE SADNESS SHAME ANGER HAPPINESS LONGING NOSTALGIA RISE IN
YOU... YOU WALK MORE AND MORE FAST NOT NOTICING WHERE YOU'RE GOING... THE PAST IS TOO PAINFUL
SO YOU FEEL AND YOU TRY TO RUN FROM IT... THEN YOU REMEMBER HOW COLLEGE WAS... ALL THOSE SNOBS
AND JERKS WHO MOCKED YOU... THE PROFESSORS WHO LOOKED THROUGH YOU AS IF YOU ARE AIR... YOUR SO
CALLED GIRLFRIEND WHO ONLY PLAYED YOU FOR A FOOL... THE ENDLESS PRESSURE FOR GOOD GRADES AND
ENDLESS TESTS AND CLASSES... AND FOR WHAT?... YOU REMEMBER THE MOMENT YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT 
ANYMORE... THE SHAME AND DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE FACE OF YOUR PARENTS WHEN YOU CAME BACK LEAVING
EVERYTHING BEHIND...  YOU START TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF HOW YOU ARE ALONE IN THE WORLD AND 
NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND YOU... YOU GOT NO MONEY NO JOB NO EDUCATION NO INCOME... MAYBE YOU CAN
WORK IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT? OR IN PIZZA DELIVERING?... MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN BY YOURSELF
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USEFUL? MAYBE YOU CAN GO OUT MORE AND AGAIN SOCIALIZE WITH PEOPLE?
BUT WHERE DO YOU BEGIN? AND HOW? WHERE IS THIS HAPPINESS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT?

YOU START REMEMBERING YOUR DREAMS AS A TEEN... TO LEARN TO PLAY THE GUITAR... TO WRITE A BOOK...
TO LEARN HOW TO PROGRAM A COMPUTER... STUFF LIKE THAT... WHAT HAPPEN TO THOUS DREAMS? THEY
ARE NOW HOBBIES... BUT THEY CAN STILL MAKE YOU SMILE AND BE HAPPY...

YOU REACH YOUR PARENT'S HOME SHORT OF BREATH AND ENTER THE DOOR AND QUIETLY ENTER YOUR ROOM...
YOUR HEAD STILL SPIN OF THOUGHTS AND YOU DECIDE TO TRY AGAIN TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE...
EVEN THE SMALLEST THING...
