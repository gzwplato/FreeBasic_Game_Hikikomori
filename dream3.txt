				THE DREAM ABOUT YOUR FAMILY...
				
YOU FALL ASLEEP AT DAWN AND DREAM... IN YOUR DREAM YOU ARE AGAIN 10 YEARS OLD AN YOU COME HOME
AFTER SCHOOL TO EAT DINNER WITH YOUR MOM YOUR OLDER SISTER AND GRANDMA YOU SIT ALL OF YOU
TOGETHER AND MOM IS LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES COMPLAIN TO GRANDMA ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE HATES HER
JOB SHE ANGRY ABOUT HER BROTHER UNCLE LOUIS SHE CAN'T STAND THE NEIGHBOURS AND YOUR OLDER 
SISTER LOOK AT ALL OF YOU WITH DISGUST AND VANITY...

GRANDMA ASK YOU HOW WAS SCHOOL AND YOU START TO TELL HOW THE OTHER KIDS IN SCHOOL BEAT YOU AND 
CALL YOU BAD NAMES... YOUR MOTHER GETS ANGRY "I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT!" SHE YELLS AT YOU
"YOU GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN AND GET AN EDUCATION NOT TO MAKE FRIENDS! SO KEEP AWAY FROM THE OTHER
PUPILS IN SCHOOL AND IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THEM KEEP IT TO YOURSELF CAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO 
KNOW!" AND YOUR SISTER LAUGH AND GIGGLE... THEN YOUR MOM KEEPS COMPLAINING TO GRANDMA ON AND 
ON...

"NOW GO TO YOUR ROOM AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK!" ORDERS YOU MOM AND YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM AND TRY TO
DO YOUR HOMEWORK BUT THE NOTEBOOKS AND BOOKS SEEM LIKE GIBBERISH AND NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND A THING...

YOU WAKE UP FEELING FURIOUS AND ANGER "HOW STUPID AND SELFISH CAN A PERSON BE!?" YOU ASK 
YOURSELF... YOUR VANE AND SELFISH OLDER SISTER AND STUPID SELFISH MOM. YOU REALIZE HOW FUCKED UP
YOU WERE RAISED BY YOUR FUCKED UP FAMILY... THEY DON'T LOVE YOU! THEY NEVER HAVE! AND THEY 
NEVER WILL!
