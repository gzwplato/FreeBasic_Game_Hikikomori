					BACK TO THE WORLD...
					
YOUR HAPPY CAUSE TODAY YOU MADE A DECISION TO CHOOSE TO GO OUT TO SOCIETY
AND TO THE WORLD AND BE PART OF THEM... NO MORE ISOLATION FOR YOU... YOU'RE GONNA
FIND A JOB AND GET SOME INCOME AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA RENT SOME PLACE OF YOUR OWN...
AND THEN YOU'LL GO OUT AND MEET PEOPLE AND SOCIALIZE WITH THEN AND MAKE NEW FRIENDS...
WHO KNOWS MAYBE YOU'LL FIND LOVE AND ROMANCE?... THAT'S THE PLAN AT LEAST...

NO MORE RUTTING IN YOUR ROOM NO MORE SLEEPING ALL DAY NO MORE LONELY NIGHTS NO MORE
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD OF LIVING YOUR LIFE... NO MORE! YOU MADE A DECISION AND
THAT'S FINAL!

YOU PLAY A CHEERFUL SONG ON YOUR GUITAR AND THEN YOU DECIDE TO GO ON A WALK OUTSIDE
TO ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL DAY...
