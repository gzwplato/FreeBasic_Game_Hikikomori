				THE NIGHTMARE...
				
YOU FALL ASLEEP IN THE AFTERNOON AND YOU HAVE A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE... YOU DREAM YOUR 
WHOLE FAMILY IS DEAD AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE YOUR OWN LIFE... YOU TRY TO HANG 
YOURSELF BUT THE POLICE GET JUST IN TIME TO STOP YOU AND CAPTURE YOU... AND YOU ARE
SENT TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE... YOU WAKE UP SWEATING...
HORRIFIED OF WHAT YOU DREAMED OF... "I GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET OUT OF THIS
SITUATION BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE" YOU TELL YOURSELF
