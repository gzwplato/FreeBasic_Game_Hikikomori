				THE NIGHTMARE...
				
YOU FALL ASLEEP IN THE AFTERNOON AND YOU HAVE A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE... YOU DREAM YOU KILLED YOUR 
WHOLE FAMILY AND ABOUT TO TAKE YOUR OWN LIFE... YOU TRY TO HANG YOURSELF BUT THE POLICE GET 
JUST IN TIME TO STOP YOU AND CAPTURE YOU... YOU ARE SENTENCE TO DEATH ROW AND AWAIT EXECUTION 
IN PRISON... YOU WAKE UP SWEATING... HORRIFIED OF WHAT YOU DREAMED OF... "I GOT TO DO SOMETHING 
TO GET OUT OF THIS SITUATION BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE" YOU TELL YOURSELF
