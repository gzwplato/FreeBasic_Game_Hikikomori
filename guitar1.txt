				THE PRAY SONG...
				
YOU PICK UP YOUR OLD DUSTY GUITAR AND CLEAN IT AND REPLACE THE STRINGS AND TUNE THEM THEN YOU 
START PLAYING SOME CHORDS AND THEN YOU START PLAYING AND SINGING A PRAY SONG TO GOD WHOM EVER 
OR WHATEVER HE/SHE/IT IS... YOU LET THE CHORDS AND WORDS JUST FLOW THROUGH YOU AND EXPRESSING 
HOW YOU FEEL AND WHAT YOU HOPE FOR - YOU SURRENDER AND PUT YOURSELF IN DIVINE HANDS AND YOU 
SING TO IT YOUR PRAY WITH NO BULLSHIT OR CYNICISM JUST YOU THE GUITAR AND GOD...

YOU PRAY FOR LOVE AND KINDNESS... STRENGTH AND COMPASSION... HOPE AND ALL THE GOOD THING YOU 
CAN IMAGINE AND WISH FOR YOURSELF AND OTHERS...

THE SONG AND PRAY GIVES YOU HOPE AND STRENGTH AND WHEN DONE AND FINISH YOU FIND YOURSELF HAPPY 
AND FEELING ALRIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG PERIOD... YOU DON'T CARE ANYMORE OF PLAYING 
THE SHAME-BLAME-TEARS-GAME... YOU ARE LOVED AND THAT'S IT YOU ARE BLESSED WITH LOVE AND YOU SEE 
ONLY THE GOOD THINGS THAT SURROUND YOU AND YOU JUST LET GO OF THE NEGATIVE...

YOU OPEN THE WINDOW AND LOOK OUTSIDE - WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY!
