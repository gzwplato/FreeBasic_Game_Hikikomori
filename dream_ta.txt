				THE DREAM ABOUT SEX...
				
YOU FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HAVE A STRANGE SAD DREAM... YOU ARE A YOUNG TEEN 
ABOUT AGE 13 AND YOU GO TO SUNDAY SCHOOL AND THE TEACHER THERE TEACHES YOU THAT "SEX AND 
MASTURBATION IS A SIN AND A CRIME IN THE EYES OF GOD AND YOU GO TO HELL FOR ETERNITY FOR 
IT!"

WHEN YOU COME HOME YOU TALK TO YOUR FATHER AND ASK HIM IF THAT'S TRUE "YES ABSOLUTELY! ONLY 
SINNERS AND PERVERTS MASTURBATE!" SAYS YOUR FATHER

"BUT ISN'T SEX AND LOVE THE SAME THING?" YOU ASK YOUR MOTHER... "OH NO!" SHE REPLAYS "SEX IS 
A DIRTY SIN AND LOVE IS A LIE... ONLY MARRIAGE FOR THE PURPOSES OF BRINGING CHILDREN TO THE 
WORLD AND MAKING A FAMILY IS NORMAL"...

THEN YOU MOVE FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT 16 AND YOU ASK YOUR HIGH SCHOOL 
COUNSELLOR IS IT OKAY TO MASTURBATE AND SHE SAYS "AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT IN THE IMAGINATION 
IT'S OKAY..."

YOU WAKE UP WITH UNDERSTANDING HOW MESSED UP YOU GROW UP AND YOU REMEMBER THE SHAME, FEAR AND 
BLAME YOU FELT TILL THESE DAYS... WHEN SEX AND MASTURBATION WAS CONSIDERED A SIN OR A TABOO...
FOR YEARS YOU FELT CURSED BY GOD AND SOCIETY FOR BEING WHO YOU ARE NEVER FINDING LOVE OR 
SOMEONE TO LOVE... ALWAYS IN THE DARK OR IN HIDING NEVER GETTING WHAT YOU NEEDED AND NEVER 
HAVING THE COURAGE TO ASK FOR IT... HOW TILL THIS DAY YOU FEEL DOOMED NOT WORTHY AND A 
DISGRACE...

YOU WAKE UP IT'S NIGHT TIME AND YOU OPEN THE COMPUTER AND SURF THE NET FOR SOME PORN...
