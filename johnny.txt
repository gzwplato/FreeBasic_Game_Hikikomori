                     THE DREAM ABOUT COLLEGE
                     
YOU FALL ASLEEP AND YOU HAVE A DREAM ABOUT COLLEGE AND ABOUT JOHNNY YOUR ROOMMATE
JOHNNY WAS A FIRST YEAR STUDENT AND HE TOLD YOU HE WAS A BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN AND
AN EVANGELIST. HE WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN YOU TOLD HIM YOU WERE JEWISH... HE WAS NICE
TO YOU ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP BUT HE KEPT TALKING TO YOU ABOUT JESUS AND THE BIBLE
ALL THE TIME... HE KEPT ASKING YOU IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD OR WHAT YOUR VALUES ARE
STUFF LIKE THAT... YOU KEPT IGNORING HIM... BUT ONE TIME YOU AND JOHNNY HAD AN UGLY
ARGUMENT WHEN YOU TOLD HIM YOU ARE NOT A BELIEVER... JOHNNY WENT MAD AS HELL AND
SINCE THEN HE QUITED BEING NICE TO YOU...

ONE NIGHT HE TOLD YOU THAT "ALL JEWS ARE DOOMED AS LONG AS THEY DON'T ACCEPT JESUS
AS THEIR LORD" AND HE KEPT ON AND ON TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU TO BELIEVE IN JESUS...
THINGS GOT SO BAD YOU HAD TO HOLD YOURSELF FROM PUNCHING HIM IN THE FACE...

THE NEXT DAY YOU ASKED TO SWITCH ROOMS AND WITHIN A WEEK YOU MOVEED OUT OF THERE...
YOUR NEW ROOMATE WAS BILL AND HE WAS THE OPPOSITE OF JHONNY HE WAS A HIPSTER WITH
GREEN-PINK-RED HAIR AND A PIRCING AND HE WAS AN EXTREM LEFT LIBERAL PERSON...
WHEN HE HEARD YOU ARE JEWISH HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO TALK ABOUT ISRAEL AND THE
PALESTINIANS AND HOW MUCH ISRAEL IS AN APARTHIEDE STATE AND AN AGGRESSIVE SUPPRESSOR
THAT SUPPRES THE PALESTINIANS... AND THINGS JUST GOT WORSE AND WORSE BILL STARTED
TO SAY THINGS LIKE "ALL JEWS ARE RASICST" AND CALLING YOU "KKK"...
YOU COMPLAINED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COLLEGE BUT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

YOU ASKED ONCE MORE TO SWITCH ROOMS AND LUCKLY YOU GOT A ROOM BY YOURSELF...

YOU WAKE UP ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED...
